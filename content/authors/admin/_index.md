Amy is a Programme Leader Track Scientist at the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, University of Cambridge and a Research Fellow at Emmanuel College, University of Cambridge. She leads the Digital Mental Health programme at the MRC CBU.

Her programme’s research examines how digital technologies affect adolescent psychological well-being and mental health. She is particularly interested in the potential cognitive, biological and social mechanisms that underlie this link in both non-clinical and clinical populations, and the influence of individual differences. To study such research questions, Amy’s team uses innovative and rigorous statistical methodology, secondary datasets, and Open Science approaches. Their results, in turn, shed new light on pressing questions debated in policy, parenting and mental health, having informed advice given by national and international experts such as the UK Chief Medical Officers and the US Surgeon General.

Amy is a member of the UK Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport “College of Experts” giving direct advice to government, as well as the British Academy Public Policy Committee. She also sits on the University of Cambridge Open Research Steering Committee and the ESRC New and Emerging Forms of Data Leadership Group. Amy has won the British Neuroscience Association Researcher Credibility Prize, the Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science Mission Award and the UK Reproducibility Network Dorothy Bishop Early Career Researcher Prize for her work to improve scientific practices.

At both the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge Amy has received nominations for student-led teaching awards.

Previous to joining the MRC CBU, Amy completed an MA in Natural Sciences at the University of Cambridge before joining the University of Oxford to obtain her DPhil in Experimental Psychology, for which she was award the BPS Award for Outstanding Doctoral Research 2019 and the Understanding Society Young Researcher Prize 2019.
